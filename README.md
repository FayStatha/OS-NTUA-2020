### First Lab

We focused on understanding how to fork processes and access files.

### Second Lab

We used signals (through terminal, or between processes).

### Third Lab

We used pipes for message transferring between processes.

### Fourth Lab

We focused on understanding how server-client connection works. We used sockets and implemented a client process, which communicated with a certain server.

#### All the assignments can be found in the folder of each lab. The assignments language is greek.
